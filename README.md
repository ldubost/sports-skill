Mycroft skill to get sports results from open data sources

## About
Get sports results from open data sources including Wikipedia

this service requires a server to treat the results and manage the sources. The code for this server is an XWiki Application provided here: https://github.com/ldubost/xwiki-sports-skill/ which currently supports only the Tennis French Open 2019.

A server is running at http://wiki-scores.org/ where you can test the capabilities of that skill.

You can hear a demo here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldubost/sports-skill/master/mycroftsports.mp3

## Examples
